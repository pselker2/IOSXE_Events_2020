## **Overview**

An event happens with an interface on an IOS XE device.  The event (an interface goes down) is the trigger to start an EEM (Embedded Event Manager) script.  The script performs the following actions:
- "show tech" and saves the output in a .txt file on the device
- Runs a python script in the guestshell

The python script performs the following actions:
- Creates a ServiceNow ticket with information about the event
- Uploads the .txt file to the ServcieNow ticket

The ServcieNow ticket performs the following action:
- Uses a Webex Teams Bot to send an alert message to a Team space stating a critical failure has occurred, provides url to view the ServiceNow ticket and provides instructions on how to start an instant meeting with all users in the space.

Below are instructions on how to enable an environment to execute this demo
